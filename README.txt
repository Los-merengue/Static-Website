Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, I deployed a website in my aws platform.

This is a project from my nanodegree program

The files included are: 

index.html - The Index document for the website.
/img - The background image file for the website.
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
/css - CSS files for the website.

After deploying the initial files there was a modification in the first index.html document

Thank you
